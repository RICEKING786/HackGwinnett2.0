# HackGwinnett2.0
This is our project for the hackathon.
We are buliding a website that will run a web application made with the MERN stack.
This will calculate the amount of money based on the weight they are carrying. 
This amount includes themselves as well as luggage.
100 dollers per pound was the rate that we used!
